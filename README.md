# High-Capacity-Image-Steganography-using-FC-DenseNet
Image Steganography is an art of embedding a secret image (the image that we do not want it to be wxposed to third person in communication)
in a carrier image (an ordinary image) without any distortation and visual changes in carrier image.
In this project we have implemented Image Steganography using FC-DenseNet which is compromied of DenseNet on three different datasets LFW, CIFAR100 and ImageNet
